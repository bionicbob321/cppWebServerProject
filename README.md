ANY OF THIS CODE, DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This project is VERY early in development, so it may not make much sense yet.

This is a simple web based app written in C++. I have not yet finalized the idea for the project itself.

There are/will be 4 parts to this app:
databse interface (C++ using winsock and sqlite)
main web server (C++ using winsock)
desktop client (C++ using QT)
web client (HTML/CSS/JS)

These are seperated into different folders, with seperate info.md files for information about the project.

Please dont grill me, im still only just learning C++ and im just putting this out there to get some constructive criticism.
